## Key Concepts for Certification

### 1. GitHub Copilot Plans
- **Individual**: Personal use, $10/month
- **Business**: Team features, $19/user/month  
- **Enterprise**: Advanced security, $39/user/month

### 2. Core Features
- Code completion and suggestions
- Inline chat and explanations
- Test generation
- Code documentation
- Bug fixes and refactoring
- Multi-language support (30+ languages)

### 3. Responsible AI Principles
- **Fairness**: Unbiased code suggestions
- **Reliability**: Consistent and accurate outputs
- **Safety**: Secure and safe code generation
- **Privacy**: Data protection and user control
- **Inclusiveness**: Accessible to all developers
- **Transparency**: Clear about AI capabilities
- **Accountability**: Human oversight required

### 4. Data Handling & Privacy
- Code snippets sent to OpenAI for processing
- Telemetry data collection (can be disabled)
- No training on private repository data (Business/Enterprise)
- Content exclusion policies available
- Data retention and deletion policies

### 5. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

#### Effective Prompts
```javascript
// Generate a function to calculate compound interest
// Parameters: principal (number), rate (decimal), time (years), frequency (compounding periods per year)
// Returns: final amount as number
// Include input validation and error handling
```

#### Context Patterns
- Describe expected inputs/outputs
- Specify error handling requirements
- Include performance considerations
- Mention security requirements
- Reference coding standards

### 6. Testing Integration
- TDD approach works best
- Descriptive test names provide context
- Include edge cases in test descriptions
- Generate both unit and integration tests
- Consider mocking requirements

### 7. Security Best Practices
- Review all generated code
- Validate input handling
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Ensure proper authentication
- Follow security coding standards
- Use content exclusion for sensitive data

### 8. Performance Optimization
- Provide performance requirements in comments
- Specify expected data sizes
- Include scalability considerations
- Mention resource constraints
- Request specific optimization techniques

## Common Use Cases

### Code Generation
- Function implementations
- Class definitions
- API endpoints
- Database queries
- Configuration files

### Code Improvement
- Refactoring suggestions
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- Code simplification
- Error handling improvements

### Documentation
- Function/class documentation
- API documentation
- Code comments
- README files
- Technical specifications

### Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Mock objects
- Test data generation

## Language-Specific Tips

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better context
- Include import statements
- Specify React/Node.js patterns
- Mention framework conventions

### Python
- Include type hints
- Specify library dependencies
- Mention PEP 8 compliance
- Include docstring requirements

### Java
- Specify design patterns
- Include annotations
- Mention framework usage (Spring, etc.)
- Reference coding conventions

### C#
- Use proper naming conventions
- Include using statements
- Specify .NET version
- Mention framework features

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Poor Prompts
- Vague descriptions
- Missing context
- No error handling requirements
- Unclear input/output specifications

### Security Issues
- Not reviewing generated code
- Trusting all suggestions blindly
- Ignoring security implications
- Missing input validation

### Integration Problems
- Not considering existing codebase
- Ignoring team conventions
- Missing dependency management
- Poor testing integration
