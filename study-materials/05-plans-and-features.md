## Feature Deep Dive

### Core AI Features (All Plans)

#### Code Completion
```python
# Example: AI-powered code completion
def calculate_monthly_payment(principal, annual_rate, years):
    # Copilot suggests complete implementation
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12 / 100
    num_payments = years * 12
    
    if monthly_rate == 0:
        return principal / num_payments
    
    monthly_payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments) / \
                     ((1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments - 1)
    return monthly_payment
```

#### Copilot Chat
```
User: "How can I optimize this database query for better performance?"

Copilot: "I can help optimize your query. Here are several approaches:

1. **Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on WHERE clause columns
2. **Query structure**: Consider JOIN order and WHERE clause placement
3. **LIMIT clauses**: Add pagination for large result sets

Would you like me to analyze a specific query?"
