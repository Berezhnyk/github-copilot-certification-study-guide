# TODO: Implementation checklist for Copilot Spaces:
# 1. Set up GraphQL federation gateway
# 2. Implement service-specific schemas in each repository
# 3. Create federated resolvers that call appropriate microservices
# 4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing REST endpoints
# 5. Implement proper error handling across service boundaries
# 6. Add monitoring and logging for federated queries
# 7. Create comprehensive tests for cross-service interactions
# 8. Document the new GraphQL API for client developers

# Expected Copilot behaviors in Spaces context:
# - Should understand service ownership and suggest appropriate resolvers
# - Should maintain type consistency across different service schemas
# - Should suggest proper federation patterns and directives
# - Should recommend backward compatibility strategies
# - Should help with performance optimization for cross-service queries
