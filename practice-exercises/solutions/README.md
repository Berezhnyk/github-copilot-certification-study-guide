## Best Practices for Using Copilot

### 1. **Write Descriptive Comments**
```python
# Calculate the shortest path between two points using A* algorithm
# considering obstacles, terrain costs, and movement constraints
def find_optimal_path(start, goal, grid, allow_diagonal=True):
```

### 2. **Provide Rich Context**
- Include relevant imports
- Define clear data structures
- Add type hints and annotations
- Use meaningful variable names

### 3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
```python
# TODO: Implement user registration with the following steps:
# 1. Validate input data (email format, password strength)
# 2. Check if user already exists in database
# 3. Hash password using bcrypt with salt rounds
# 4. Save user to database with created_at timestamp
# 5. Send welcome email with verification link
# 6. Return success response with user ID
```

### 4. **Iterate and Refine**
- Start with basic implementation
- Add error handling and edge cases
- Optimize for performance
- Add comprehensive testing
- Improve documentation

### 5. **Use Multiple Languages**
Different exercises use various programming languages to demonstrate Copilot's versatility:
- **Python**: ML, data processing, APIs
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Web applications, Node.js services
- **Go**: Microservices, high-performance backends

- **Java**: Enterprise applications, Spring Boot
- **SQL**: Database operations and optimization

## Testing Your Solutions

Each starter file includes suggestions for testing:

### Unit Tests
```python
def test_recommendation_algorithm():
    # TODO: Test recommendation accuracy with sample data
    # TODO: Verify performance meets latency requirements
    # TODO: Test edge cases (empty history, new users)
```

### Integration Tests
```python
def test_api_endpoints():
    # TODO: Test full request/response cycle
    # TODO: Verify authentication and authorization
    # TODO: Test error handling and edge cases
```

## Getting Help

### If Copilot Isn't Working Well:
1. **Add more context** in comments
2. **Break down the task** into smaller steps
3. **Provide examples** of expected input/output
4. **Use more specific language** in prompts
5. **Include relevant imports** and dependencies

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue**: Copilot suggests incorrect code
**Solution**: Add type hints, examples, and constraints

**Issue**: Suggestions are too generic
**Solution**: Provide more specific requirements and context

**Issue**: Code doesn't compile or run
**Solution**: Include proper imports and verify syntax

**Issue**: Performance is poor
**Solution**: Add performance requirements in comments
